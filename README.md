# xBoon.
Bypass whitelist and root detection on Boon Payments to use mobile payment on rooted or unsupported devices.

# Note to Users
Please note I no longer support this Xposed module. It was merely a one-off and it's very difficult for me to support due to the restrictions the application imposes on people outside of europe (ie. I can not even register because my number is outside of a NZ mobile number). 

# Note to Developers
This repository is available for someone who wishes to continue to this project as a contributer to the already existing Github Repo and Xposed Repo Page. If you do use this code in your own projects, please write my name in credits.
